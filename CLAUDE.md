# CLAUDE.md — kubernetes

## What this repo is

The **Kubernetes** GraphL concept app, served at `graphl.in/kubernetes/`. The syllabus is
`KUBERNETES-COURSE-PLAN.md` (13 chapters, 88 sections); how it is authored, measured and handed
over is `AUTHORING-PLAN.md`. One chapter = one course; one numbered item = one section.

A GraphL concept app: one concept, N courses, each course a list of sections. A **section** is
`(scene, slide, narration)` and is one segment of the course video. One section = one slide.

The render engine is `@graphlearning/flow`; the app shell is `@graphlearning/shell`. Both are
**published packages pinned by version** (`flow@^1.2.0`, `shell@^0.8.0`). This repo's own surface is
`src/content/`, `src/scenes/`, `src/main.tsx` and `src/theme.css` — nothing else.

## Route contract

`#/<course>-<section>`, e.g. `#/reconciliation-desired-vs-observed`. `#/` is the catalog.
Section ids are permanent once a course has wavs — audio resolves by id alone.

## Course arc and scene inventory

| # | course | status | scenes (`src/scenes/<course>/`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `reconciliation` | authored, no audio | orchestration-scope · reconcile-loop · cluster-anatomy · request-path · build-vs-run · environments |
| 2–13 | see `AUTHORING-PLAN.md` §1 | not started | — |

Recurring example throughout: the catalogue API, its PostgreSQL database and the import Job, in one
learning namespace. Manifests and outputs on code cards are **illustrative** and say so — no
cluster was run.

## Invariants — do not break

- **Never write `x` or `y`.** Scenes are declarative: nodes, edges, nesting. `computeLayout` is not
  exported, so there is no way around this, and that is the point — reproducible frames.
- **Do not reimplement the shell.** `SectionView`, `CourseIndex`, `SlidePanel` and the hooks are
  withheld on purpose. The route contract (`#/<courseId>-<sectionId>`, `?capture=1`,
  `window.__scene.plan()`) is what every recorder drives, and it holds only if every repo composes
  the pieces identically.
- **`SiteHeader` goes on the catalog page only** — never on a section. A section is a video frame.
- **Three stylesheets, in cascade order**, imported in `main.tsx`. The order is load-bearing:
  1. `@graphlearning/flow/styles.css` — react-flow plus the IBM Plex faces the engine is
     *calibrated* to. `codeMetrics` sizes code nodes from a measured 9.02px glyph advance, so a
     different monospace face mis-sizes every code card. Carries the `.tok-*` colours.
  2. `@graphlearning/shell/styles.css` — the shell paints the canvas (`--bg: #1a1d23`; SceneView
     draws its dots at `#2a2f38` assuming a dark surface).
  3. `./theme.css` — this repo's three brand tokens. **Last, or the brand loses to the defaults.**
- **`file:../ui-flow` / `file:../ui-shell` must never be committed.** Local engine work only; CI has
  no sibling checkout.
- **Narration is never hand-produced.** `.tts` → `.wav` via Colab + Chatterbox only.

## Layout rules the frames actually care about

`npm run check` (`scripts/check-content.mjs`) models four silent failures — each builds green and
breaks only on screen. Its comments carry the measured constants; the short version:

- **Leaf cards are a fixed 210×96** with a ~134px text column. Only containers grow to fit. Keep the
  `label` to 2 wrapped lines; 2 label lines + 2 sub lines fits. Watch unbreakable tokens — `_`, `.`
  and `/` are **not** break opportunities in CSS, so `snake_case` and paths overflow sideways in a
  way the height model cannot see.
- **Slides do not scale to fit.** Type size is fixed by the frame (`zoom = paneWidth / 806`,
  width-proportional only), so an over-long slide **clips at the bottom** with no error.
  `check` fails over 1000 modelled design px; the band below gives the floor too. Bullets cost far
  more than prose of the same length.
- **A `focus:` that names no node in its scene is a silent no-op** — nothing lights up.
- **`icon:` names are NOT guarded.** The engine's lucide registry is `Record<string, LucideIcon>`
  and does not enumerate its keys, so a wrong name type-checks, passes `check`, builds, and renders
  a card with no glyph. There are ~75 valid keys; copy one off an existing scene rather than
  guessing a lucide name (`volume`, `move`, `maximize` and `git` are all absent, for instance).
- **A section with no wav narrates silence** and records a silent segment. Audio resolves purely by
  convention: `public/audio/<course>/<section-id>.wav`.

What `check` does *not* model: an edge label landing on top of a card, or whether the frame is too
empty. Look at the route.

### Density targets — the frame must use the space it has

The guarded failure is a slide that overflows. The unguarded one is its opposite: a frame that
builds green, reads correctly, and leaves half its pane empty. Against the ~1080 design px pane:

| | target | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| slide height | **80–95 %** of the pane (≈ 865–1025px; `SLIDE_H_MAX` caps the top at 1000) | below 80 % the right half looks empty; above ~95 % it risks clipping |
| scene, binding axis | ≥ 0.85 of the pane | the board should reach the edge it is limited by |
| scene, area | ≥ 0.55 of the pane (w × h) | a wide board that fills the width but a third of the height wastes the pane |
| eyebrow | no node under the top-left eyebrow label | boards that bind on height run up to y≈30 |

Levers: **add real content, not padding**; **restack** a board toward the pane's ~1:1 aspect; lower
scene `padding` to 0.04 for boards that float, **raise** it (0.12–0.17) for tall boards that touch
the eyebrow.

`check` models no density at all; **`npm run density`** (`scripts/density.mjs`, with `npm run dev`
running) measures it off the rendered route — slide fill, scene bind/area, eyebrow clearance and
edge-label collisions — and `DENSITY_SHOTS=<dir>` saves a PNG per section to look at. The ratios
came from another repo's ~80 frames, so a deliberately sparse board can sit under them. Targets,
not thresholds.

Measured in this repo (flow 1.3, shell 0.8 — `AUTHORING-PLAN.md` §3 has the detail):

- `bind` is just `1 / (1 + padding)` — 0.89 at the default 0.12. Area and eyebrow are the levers.
- **One row of leaves fails area** (~0.40–0.48). Use `cols: 2` grids, 2×2 `list` cards, stacked
  bands.
- Slides need ~2–3 `###` groups and 8–11 bullets for 80 %.
- `check` over-models **ordered lists** by ~150–200px; OL-heavy slides top out near 78 %.
- A leaf's `badge` does not render — put step numbers somewhere else.

## Guards before handing over

```sh
npm run build && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run check
npm run dev & npm run density      # rendered density, every section
```

All of these are a **floor, not proof** — they pass on frames that are visually wrong. The rendered
route is the real bar, and the owner reviews it.

## Working agreement

- **Author the whole unit, then hand over the route.** Scenes, slides and narration together.
- **No ASCII sketches of scenes.** A sketch cannot show what the layout engine will do, which is the
  only thing worth looking at.
- **No silent scaffolding**, no work outside the ask. Say plainly what was built, what was verified,
  and what was left out.
